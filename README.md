## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose (20.10+)
- Git

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Mes-Open/OpenMes.git
cd OpenMes

# 2. Run setup script
./setup.sh

# 3. (Optional) Edit .env to change passwords
nano .env  # Set DB_PASSWORD and DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD

# 4. Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# 5. Wait for containers to be healthy (30-60 seconds)
docker-compose ps

# 6. Run database migrations and seed data
docker-compose exec backend php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# 7. Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost
# API: http://localhost:8000/api
# Default login: admin / CHANGE_ON_FIRST_LOGIN
```

**That's it!** 🎉 OpenMES is now running.

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Mes-Open/OpenMes.git
cd OpenMes

# 2. Copy environment files
cp .env.example .env
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

# 3. Generate APP_KEY
docker-compose run --rm backend php artisan key:generate

# 4. Update .env with your passwords
nano .env

# 5. Continue from step 4 above
docker-compose up -d
```

### First Steps After Installation

1. **Login** with default credentials (admin / CHANGE_ON_FIRST_LOGIN)
2. **Change your password** when prompted
3. **Create production lines** in the admin panel
4. **Add operators** and assign them to lines
5. **Import work orders** via CSV or create manually
6. **Install PWA on tablets** for offline support

### Troubleshooting

**Containers not starting?**
```bash
# Check container logs
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend
docker-compose logs postgres

# Restart containers
docker-compose restart

# Rebuild containers
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

**Database connection errors?**
```bash
# Make sure postgres is healthy
docker-compose ps

# Check database credentials in .env match docker-compose.yml
grep DB_PASSWORD .env

# Restart backend
docker-compose restart backend
```

**Frontend not loading?**
```bash
# Check if frontend is running
curl http://localhost:5173

# Rebuild frontend
docker-compose build frontend
docker-compose up -d frontend
```

**Port conflicts?**
```bash
# Check if ports are already in use
sudo lsof -i :80    # nginx
sudo lsof -i :8000  # backend
sudo lsof -i :5432  # postgres

# Change ports in docker-compose.yml if needed
```
